## Password manager ðŸ”‘

This local password manager will help you save all accounts information securely.

It features a user-friendly GUI interface that is both visually appealing and easy to navigate.
If you're unsure whether you've already registered on a particular website, simply click the `Search`
button to quickly retrieve the relevant information in a pop-up window. <br>

Additionally, the built-in `Password generator` allows you to create strong passwords with a combination of 
letters, symbols, and numbers (12-16 characters long), ensuring enhanced security for your accounts.

For added security, it's important to avoid using the same password for multiple accounts (you can't save 1 password 2 times). <br>

When using the manager for the first time, clicking the `Add` button will automatically create a new file to store your data.
Subsequently, new account information will be appended to this file.
